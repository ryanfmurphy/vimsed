The vimsed script makes vim behave kind of like sed. 

Syntax: vimsed "<vim normal-mode keystrokes>"

vimsed will "pipe" stdin to stdout, modifying it first by running the keystrokes.

Note/Warning: Uses temporary files temp, temp.vim and temp2 in the ~ directory.

Example:

$ vimsed ":s/e/i/g"
(user input:)
hello
hello
( to terminate user input)
(vimsed output:)
hillo
hello
